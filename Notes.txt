Todo:
update player supply and castle data
  on move and attack completion##Server > open game should pass in AllData instead of just game to startGame(). Reorganize so this can filter down to getSupply for map data.

  -check for win

  on init

Season card draw logic
Season card effects:
  Disallow placing of march+1 and all from other order types
  Bid for tracks
  collect PTs
  muster
  update supply
  wildlings attack - just the hook
  Choice cards - muster/supply/nothing, collect/bid/nothing, noMarch+1/nodefense/nothing

  log decisions to be made to conditional actions for: muster, bidding, wildlings, choice cards

Client side in React
Client side of decisions from above



Bugs/Improvements:
Movement:
-Cant chain moves together (move unit twice in same turn)
-Improve order validation (client)
-Move priority not implemented
-Consolidate Power plays too early - keep them on the board until conditional round so that you can gain a poop by taking a city.
-Update castles upon move

Attacking:
Add client-side interface
Code to resolve attacks based on card selection
Retreated unit status
Remove orders from attacked square on successful attack

Message logging:
Player name instead of ID
Save messages to DB w/ game


HTML:
-no display for player, player statistics (power tokens, supply), game tracks, # castles,
-no div to choose PTs in bidding, cards during attacks
-chat screen improvements
-Show game pieces, power tokens, cards in a div
-game board tiles - show total defense + support


-Have an option that allows you to redirect troops after seeing orders instead of just playing moves immediately. This adds more gameplay but will take longer.
-(Allow real-time-ish gameplay vs turn-based)


#Start transition of HTML to templates. Variables will be useful moving forward for all types of displays.

When to update square's defense display:
DONE - on player init - server - units only
  -Go through each owned square and run updateOwnedSquare

on order placement (and change) - client
  -support updates its neighbors and sends data to client

DONE - on raid - server runs updateOwnedSquareOrders with remove=true

on move and on attack completion - server gets neighbors and if any support is removed from neighbors as a result of an attack it updates ownedSquare accordingly

DONE - at end of turn - server
  - clear out defense, support. not unit strength.


Phase 2:
Wildlings attacks and effects
Ships in port
