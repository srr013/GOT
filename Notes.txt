To do:

Can currently establish a session but there's no real link between the session and a user in Mongo. Need to store/retrieve users and games from Mongo before proceeding.

Make HTML for join, open, create game, sign out form

Implement action forms on client and action functions in Game
  funcs: raid, move/attack, defense, support, consolidate power, submit data (any form)
  client forms: action form for above actions, bidding form for tracks and wildlings, choice form for season cards.
  Submit turn action > tie into Game.playersReady


Deck, card file read & import, card object setup

Implement Card-related functions in Game.
  -fighting: swords and fortress

Implement client DOM updates and HTML updates using data from Game:
  activity log (main source of game info)
  square display and updating
    display: Castle/Stronghold, square ID, selected move, number and type of units + defense + support


Phase 2:
